//! The `Value` type is too complex to make `#[repr(C)]` from scratch. This is
//! why this module declares `PdkValue` as the FFI-safe alternative to
//! communicate with the plugins. It's a copy from the original one, but the
//! collections have been replaced with `abi_stable`'s (e.g. `Box` for `RBox`).
//!
//! `PdkValue` is only meant to be used for the PDK interface. A plugin or the
//! runtime can convert between `PdkValue` and `Value` at a relatively small
//! cost, and use its full functionality that way.
//!
//! Although this decision might sound like a considerable performance overhead,
//! it would be even worse to try to make `Value` fully `#[repr(C)]` as it is
//! right now. The collections in `abi_stable` are much more basic than what the
//! original `Value` uses, such as `beef::Cow` or `halfbrown::HashMap`. Not only
//! are these types by themselves more efficient for Tremor's use-case, but also
//! their functionality is consierably improved, making it impossible to for
//! example implement the known-key optimization for a `Value` if we were to use
//! `RHashMap`.
